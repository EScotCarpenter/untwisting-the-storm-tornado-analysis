abstract={To serve the public interest and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) storm data record, the National Weather Service (NWS) documents the path length, width, and maximum damage rating for every tornado county segment (NOAA 2007).1 Such data are used in meteorological and climatological research, as well as in determining construction standards for critical infrastructure such as high-tension electric lines and nuclear power plants (e.g., Ramsdell et al. 2007). Because of the historic lack of direct measurements and remotely sensed tornado wind speeds at or near ground level, damage surveying has remained the most common method for indicating tornado strength.},
